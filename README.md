This is a website I programmed for CSC412 Advanced Software Lab. The assignment was to make a website on whatever we wanted using HTML, CSS,
Javascript, PHP, Bootstrap, Java/Python/C++ and JQUERY.

My inspiration for the project was to create a website remniscent of websites I saw when I was a child on the internet, but with added
effects and formatting to make it more modern as well. I utilized my skills to create a website I was happy with.

Thank you for taking a chance to look at my website!
